            <h3>By Car (from M4)</h3>
            <p>If travelling by car from the M4 motorway, leave at Junction 7 sign posted Slough West and Maidenhead. Take the Spur Road, and at the roundabout turn left onto the A4 following signs to Maidenhead. Go through the traffic lights and continue forward. At the small roundabout by Sainsbury’s (you’ll see it on the left hand side) go straight on, ignoring signs for Taplow, until you go under a railway arch. Drive for approximately 200 yards, and at the first set of traffic lights by the BMW garage, Berry Hill will be the right hand turn.  Turn right into Berry Hill and follow the road. Taplow House is on the right hand side after approximately 150 yards (just after the traffic island).</p>

            <h3>By Car (from M40)</h3>
            <p>If travelling by car from the M40 motorway, leave at Junction 2 sign posted Slough and Beaconsfield, and take the Slough exit. Get in the far right hand lane and in approximately 100 yards take the first right hand junction (just after traffic lights) towards Burnham. Follow the lane for a short way; go down the hill and follow the road as it takes a sharp left. Continue along the lane, and at the top of the hill go through the ‘chicane’. After a short distance the lane takes sharp right on the corner with Abbey Park Lane. Follow the road to the right (not straight on into Abbey Park Lane!), and keep going, past the Jolly Woodsman pub and a small church on your left hand side. Take the first right after the church, sign posted Taplow and Wooburn, on the corner with Dropmore Infant school. After approximately 200 yards, turn left into Heathfield Road. Keep following the lane, passing Cliveden House gates on the right and The Feathers pub on the left. Continue down the road for approximately 2 miles and into Taplow village (the road winds a bit here). Taplow House is on the left hand side if you follow the high brick wall, just before the traffic island.</p>

            <h3>By Train</h3>
            <p>If travelling by train, you can use either Taplow or Maidenhead stations. Taxis are available from Maidenhead train station.</p>
            <p>We recommend using Maidenhead station as trains run more frequently (approximately every 20-30 minutes), and Taplow does not have a taxi rank.</p>
